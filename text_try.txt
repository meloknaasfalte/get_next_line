Now the King was minded to go on a pilgrimage,
and he agreed with the Queen that he would set forth to seek the holy chapel at St. Augustine,
which is in the White Forest, and may only be found by adventure.
Much he wished to undertake the quest alone, but this the Queen would not suffer,
and to do her pleasure he consented that a youth, tall and strong of limb,
should ride with him as his squire.
Chaus was the youth’s name, and he was son to Gwain li Aoutres.
“Lie within to-night,” commanded the King, “and take heed that my horse be saddled at break of day, and my arms ready.
“At your pleasure, Sir,” answered the youth, whose heart rejoiced because he was going alone with the King.
